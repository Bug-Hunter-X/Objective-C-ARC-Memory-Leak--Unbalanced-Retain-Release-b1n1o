In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises from the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and manual memory management using `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease`.  Forgetting to balance these calls, especially when dealing with custom objects or complex object graphs, can lead to memory leaks or unexpected crashes. Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
}
@end

- (void)myMethod {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"]; // String is retained here
    // ...some code...
    [obj release]; // Missing release for myString
}
```
In this example, the `myString` property (using strong reference) retains the string.  If `[obj release]` is called but the string is not explicitly released using `[obj.myString release]` (or through ARC), a memory leak occurs because the string object will never be deallocated.  It's also important to consider cycles. If object A retains object B and object B retains object A, neither will ever be deallocated.
