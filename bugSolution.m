To fix this, ensure that memory management is correctly handled. With ARC, this usually means using strong or weak properties appropriately and avoid manual retain/release unless absolutely necessary.  In the case where manual management is necessary, strict pairing of `retain` and `release` is crucial. Here's how to correct the original code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    NSLog(@"MyClass deallocated");
    //In Modern Objective-C, dealloc is rarely needed and often automatically handled by ARC.
}
@end

- (void)myMethod {
    MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
    obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ...some code...
    obj = nil; // ARC will handle the release.
}
```
Using ARC, setting `obj` to `nil` is sufficient; ARC will release the object and its strong references. Manual release is generally unnecessary in modern Objective-C development using ARC.
